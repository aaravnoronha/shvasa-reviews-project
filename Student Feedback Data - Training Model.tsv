1	Quality could not hear her
2.5	It has been too long since I did beginners. This was too hard for me 
1	Your app and instructions aren’t clear. Confusing!
1	as I am still learning yoga sometimes I am not familiar  with pose names instead of just saying pose name it would be better if teacher explains it example chaturnanga and say it like right leg back and left leg back. overall not happy with the class had to leave in middle as I felt no proper explanation.
2	before and during the asanas there is a lack of flow and the instructions are missing at most of the times. Should have been more in sync so I could understand the asanas better
2.5	 I had some difficulty  understanding  what to do. Due to the placement of my camera...I feel so tired,stiff and frustrated during the pace of the class. However,I feel motivated to learn more,stretch more,breath and focus better. Thank you!
3	more detailed instructions needed
1	more relaxed pleasant teacher

3	There were no visual clues from the teacher. The teacher was not demonstrating the poses and there were new poses that I had not done before. No instructions on how to achieve the pose.  The class seemed to be just to somehow get through a set of poses. There are alternate and step by step ways to get to a final pose for beginners. Those should be taught. It is good when teachers are demonstrating and doing the poses at least initially. Variety will also be good rather than the same thing everyday. It makes it interesting.

2	I don’t think it was for beginners I felt sick to my stomach was too much🤦🏽‍♀️
4	 Being a mixed class with both beginners and intermediate; it is sometimes difficult to keep up as I am not there yet and cannot do a lot of the poses. The teacher is trying to handle both together well. Getting words of encouragement is good as it makes us want to do better or know that we are getting there.  The following is a general comment and not related to the instructor. Maybe Shvasa could add some videos on how to get to the final pose through step by step instructions. There are lot of reels and videos out there that show. E.g, shoulder stand, through trying it against the wall and then moving away or forward bending through learning to do it first with bended knees etc., |There are videos that show how to first get the required muscles relaxed and stretched to achieve the final pose. Mybe using bricks initially to lift off the floor etc.
5	Very calm and composed vibes from Barsha during the session with rightly required pace & knowledge of asanas
3	 Lot of noises barking dog, vehicle noises and other household noises
4.5	I loved the classes
5	 Taking class for complete 60 minutes will be helpful. Usually, class ends between 50 to 55 minutes.
5	I loved the classes
5	 Loved the inclusion of meditation in the class. We did a lot of asanas and practices but it did not seem rushed. It was so methodical with lot of modifications and the pace was just right. Great teacher. Audio was not clear. It was difficult to hear the instructions clearly.
3	Teacher used the video feed of one of the students to demonstrate poses/practice
1	the class never started
5	 i was feeling giddy in between the session, so i had to take a short break.
5	awesome today - new asanas - yay
4	I loved the classes
2	 I had a session with another instructor who would actually correct your position and went a little slower. For someone just trying to learn what sequence of poses to hold, it was very difficult to follow along and if I had my face looking forward, I would not be able to understand the instructions based on audio. The previous instructor said things like “Right leg forward, left leg back, xyz pose” so I could not only learn what the correct name of the poses were, but I could also follow along until I learned the names of the positions. Would not take this class again.

5	Great variations and perfect pace. Class was awesome. Gave clear instructions to both beginners and regular practitioners.

5	Really liked the modification teacher took after the class i really feel fresh and full of energy.
4	 teacher couldve been more interactive, was speaking too fast especially in shvasana
5	 Learned a lot of new stretches today and it was good and slow.   The only thing is that the teacher's audio becomes choppy and unclear when they are not facing the camera or lying down.

5	 Vineeth sir is not only master of his art which is Yoga, but also master of teaching methodology when it comes to imparting his knowledge. His instructions are crystal clear and makes me feel comfortable. I prefer to practice only under his guidance. I wish he would take some early morning classes from the time slots between 6am - 9am
5	Coach paid attention to everyone..
5	 But your app is not working, in iOS.
5	Beautiful relaxation/meditation & chanti.
5	 Love the music in the background as well, it helps
4	the tempo of the music in shvasana was very fast. cannot relax in it or go within.
4	 Class is good , no doubt about it. However I noticed few things in today's class and sharing here...it will be great if instructor give small breaks or child pose asanas in bw it get our breath back ! Also not sure,  highlighting one person through out the classis comfortable to that person and also to others ( not saying this out of jealousy) . Usually attendees look up for instructor and its totally fine if one person in class is performing good and highlighting for particular time for that asana . Whole class running on one person is like that person is taking class . It's my opinion. Apart from this I enjoyed the class and sequence . Again it's my personal opinion and not against with anyone .

1	 For the new asanas, giving the instructions one time and moving ahead does not help. I was stuck most of this class and was sitting idle without knowing what to do. With a mix of seasoned practitioners and beginners, the class has to be conducted in such a way to allow everyone to progress. Instructions and demonstrations need to be repeated so we can pick up as we may not get the whole pose with one set of instructions. I felt so demotivated and deflated after the class.  Also, the quality and pace of the suryanamaskar should be considered over the quantity. Doing a fewer number of suryanamaskars, slower and keeping each pose for a few seconds should be considered, rather than many rounds. I am not sure why the variety of class offerings at 6am has reduced and is now a mix of intermediate and beginners. Also there are no weight loss or other options available at 6.
5	What a difference from yesterday! We were given clear instructions and demonstrations.
3	 teacher practiced for just 49 minutes maximum...he ,mentioned its a 90 min practice we will do in 60 min but in 49 min asanas ended why?

5	He is one of the best instructor
5	Patanjali is one of the best
3	 Most of the time teacher was not showing how to do the asanas, she was doing some asanas and just giving instructions for other asanas... For beginners it would be beneficial if she can do and show each and every asana
