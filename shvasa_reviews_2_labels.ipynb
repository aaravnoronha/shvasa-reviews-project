No instructions on how to achieve the pose.  The class seemed to be just to somehow get through a set of poses. There are alternate and step by step ways to get to a final pose for beginners. Those should be taught. It is good when teachers are demonstrating and doing the poses at least initially. Variety will also be good rather than the same thing everyday. It makes it interesting.\n",

The teacher is trying to handle both together well. Getting words of encouragement is good as it makes us want to do better or know that we are getting there.  The following is a general comment and not related to the instructor. Maybe Shvasa could add some videos on how to get to the final pose through step by step instructions. There are lot of reels and videos out there that show. E.g, shoulder stand, through trying it against the wall and then moving away or forward bending through learning to do it first with bended knees etc., |There are videos that show how to first get the required muscles relaxed and stretched to achieve the final pose. Mybe using bricks initially to lift off the floor etc.\n",

For someone just trying to learn what sequence of poses to hold, it was very difficult to follow along and if I had my face looking forward, I would not be able to understand the instructions based on audio. The previous instructor said things like “Right leg forward, left leg back, xyz pose” so I could not only learn what the correct name of the poses were, but I could also follow along until I learned the names of the positions. Would not take this class again.\n",

      "  Feedback:  Class is good , no doubt about it. However I noticed few things in today's class and sharing here...it will be great if instructor give small breaks or child pose asanas in bw it get our breath back ! Also not sure,  highlighting one person through out the classis comfortable to that person and also to others ( not saying this out of jealousy) . Usually attendees look up for instructor and its totally fine if one person in class is performing good and highlighting for particular time for that asana . Whole class running on one person is like that person is taking class . It's my opinion. Apart from this I enjoyed the class and sequence . Again it's my personal opinion and not against with anyone .\n",

      "  Feedback:  For the new asanas, giving the instructions one time and moving ahead does not help. I was stuck most of this class and was sitting idle without knowing what to do. With a mix of seasoned practitioners and beginners, the class has to be conducted in such a way to allow everyone to progress. Instructions and demonstrations need to be repeated so we can pick up as we may not get the whole pose with one set of instructions. I felt so demotivated and deflated after the class.  Also, the quality and pace of the suryanamaskar should be considered over the quantity. Doing a fewer number of suryanamaskars, slower and keeping each pose for a few seconds should be considered, rather than many rounds. I am not sure why the variety of class offerings at 6am has reduced and is now a mix of intermediate and beginners. Also there are no weight loss or other options available at 6.\n",
